                The website parallax effect is a popular design technique that creates an engaging and immersive user experience by manipulating the movement of background and foreground elements as the user scrolls. In this effect, background images or layers move at a slower rate than the foreground content, producing an illusion of depth and motion. This can enhance the visual appeal of a website, drawing users in and encouraging them to explore further. Parallax scrolling is achieved using a combination of CSS and JavaScript, allowing designers to create dynamic, interactive web pages that capture attention and convey a sense of sophistication and modernity. By breaking the static nature of traditional web design, the parallax effect helps in creating memorable and visually stunning websites.
